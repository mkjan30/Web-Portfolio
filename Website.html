           <h1>Why I Learn Web Design</h1>
           <p>Web design can be great for creative types because it allows you to create something both beautiful and functional, all from your computer. If you are looking for a way to use your artistic side, web design is a great way to do it. In today's world, learning how to design websites can be an incredibly useful skill.Beginning web development is relatively easy - you only need your web browser and an editor. Both should be installed on your computer already. Don't get me wrong, it takes a lot to develop great web applications like e.g. Google Docs, but barrier of entry is very low.Web development let's you express yourself. You can try everything you want and share it with the world.</p>

                What is the future of web developers?
            </h2>
            <p>Nowdays different themes make it easier for user to create website.They just have to write the content for it.Word press is leading website that provides free as well as custom paid themes for its user.The themes takes a lot of bandwidth so the content loading is slow and it may not be secure.What i am saying that you can create personal blog without programming knowledge..For commercial company which handles monetary transaction and customer information can't be build with such themes.They have team of skilled web developers for such job.They should secure, very customized and optimized for handling a lot of confendential datas.Similiary another important aspect of web designing is SEO(Search Engine Optimization) that means there are many website which content match but they have a ranking..when a user enters a search, the engine index the result based on the matched meta data present in website..So if you want a customer ,you need a efficient content writer for your websites.Random writing won't get you visitors and customers.Note that the themes that make non-programmers easier to create websites are also developed by skilled web developers.and the website claiming that you do not need programming skill is their stragety to attract customers who will pay for their themes.So it is good on a personal level that you do not need programming skill to develop a website..But a company will hire a skilled web developer for their job.So web developers are highly seeked...</p>

                    What is a Web Developer?
                </h3>
                <p> A web developer is responsible for programming the code that “tells” a website how to function. A developer builds a website from the bottom up, which means designing it in such a way that end users have no difficulty navigating the site. The website should not be so simple that it does not appeal to advanced users, nor should it be so complicated that the beginner is easily lost in the process.Large-scale web projects often divide these tasks among multiple web developers.</p>

                    What does a Web Developer do?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    A web developer builds and maintains websites with the client and consumer in mind. That is, the end design must include products and services offered and show how users may access these. For example, a customer may want a form to capture an end user’s e-mail to request additional information, provide a newsletter, or thank a customer for their business. One type of developer may focus on setting up the back end of a site (back-end developer) while another may focus on the client side to add style and functionality to the website itself (front-end developer). After a website is up and running, developers make sure that the site is functional on all web browsers, testing and updating as needed. Web developers are familiar with technology and understand how computers and web servers operate. They are also very familiar with many software programs, web applications and web programming languages, such as hypertext markup language (HTML), JavaScript (JS), Ruby on Rails, and C++. They must be able to communicate effectively, set goals and meet deadlines.
